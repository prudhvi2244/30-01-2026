ArrayList
=================
1)Remove Duplicates from an ArrayList
2)Given an ArrayList<Integer>, remove all duplicate elements without using Set.
3)Find Second Largest Element
4)Find the second largest number in an ArrayList<Integer>.
5)Rotate ArrayList to the Right by k Positions

Example: [1,2,3,4,5], k=2 → [4,5,1,2,3].

LinkedList
==================
1)Reverse a LinkedList
2)Reverse the elements of a LinkedList<String> without using Collections.reverse().
3)Find Middle Element of LinkedList
4)Return the middle element using the slow and fast pointer approach.
5)Check if LinkedList is Palindrome

Example: [1,2,3,2,1] → true.

Vector
==================
Thread-Safe Add and Remove
1)Create a Vector<Integer> and demonstrate adding 10 elements and removing all even numbers while iterating safely.
2)Frequency Count of Elements
3)Given a Vector<String>, print how many times each word appears.

Stack
=========
Balanced Parentheses Checker
1)Use Stack<Character> to check if a string like "((a+b)*c)" has balanced brackets.
2)Reverse a String Using Stack
Input: "JAVA" → Output: "AVAJ" using Stack<Character>

Assignment 1 – Remove Duplicates from Array

Create an integer array with duplicate values.
Use HashSet to remove duplicates and print unique elements.

Assignment 2 – Count Unique Words

Take a sentence as input.
Store each word in a HashSet and print the number of unique words.

Assignment 3 – Maintain Insertion Order

Store 10 city names entered by the user in a LinkedHashSet.
Print them in the same order they were entered.

Assignment 4 – Sort Student Marks

Store student marks in a TreeSet.
Print them in ascending order and then in descending order.

Assignment 5 – Find Common Elements of Two Arrays

Given two integer arrays, use HashSet to find and print common elements.

Assignment 6 – First and Last Element

Store some numbers in a TreeSet.
Print the first (smallest) and last (largest) elements.

Assignment 7 – Remove Specific Range

Store numbers 1 to 20 in a TreeSet.
Remove all numbers less than 10 and print the remaining elements.

(Hint: use tailSet() or removeIf())

Assignment 8 – Check Palindrome Words

Given a list of words, store them in a LinkedHashSet.
Print only those words which are palindrome (like “madam”, “level”).

Assignment 9 – Find Next Higher and Lower

Store some integers in a TreeSet.
Ask the user for a number and print:

next higher number

next lower number

(Hint: use higher() and lower())

Assignment 10 – Union of Two Sets

Create two HashSets with some numbers.
Find the union of both sets and print the result.

(Hint: use addAll())
